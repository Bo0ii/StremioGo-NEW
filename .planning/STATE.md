### Blockers/Concerns

**From Phase 1:**
1. Complex Plus Page integration (280 lines across multiple functions) - mitigation: detailed removal plan with line numbers ready
2. Main process IPC handlers (93 lines) - mitigation: clear boundary markers identified
3. TypeScript strict mode may catch missed references - benefit: will prevent incomplete removal
4. Resources directory cleanup needed - reminder: delete bundled MPV binaries after core removal

## Session Continuity
