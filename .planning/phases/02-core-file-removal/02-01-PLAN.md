<objective>
Remove native player UI component directories from codebase.

Purpose: Eliminate UI layer of MPV integration (injector and controls components) as first cleanup step, establishing foundation for remaining integration removal.
Output: Two component directories deleted, git commit documenting removal.

**Tech stack available:**
- TypeScript 5.7.2 (strict mode)
- Electron 37.3.1
- Component pattern: TS + HTML template pairs

**Established patterns:**
- Components in `src/components/` with directory per component
- HTML templates copied to `dist/components/` during build
- Deletion requires removing both source and compiled output

**Constraining decisions:**
- Phase 1 identified these directories as self-contained UI components
- No other code imports from these directories yet (imports will be removed in Phase 5)
- Safe to delete before editing integration points

**Issues being addressed:**
- Complete removal of MPV/V5 integration as planned in PROJECT.md

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Remove native-player-controls component directory</name>
  <files>src/components/native-player-controls/ (entire directory)</files>
  <action>Delete the entire `src/components/native-player-controls/` directory containing nativePlayerControls.ts and native-player-controls.html. This component provides UI controls for MPV player and is no longer needed. Use file system operations to remove the directory and all contents.</action>
  <verify>Directory no longer exists: `ls src/components/native-player-controls 2>&1` should return "No such file or directory"</verify>
  <done>Directory src/components/native-player-controls/ deleted from filesystem</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Remove native-player-injector component directory</name>
  <files>src/components/native-player-injector/ (entire directory)</files>
  <action>Delete the entire `src/components/native-player-injector/` directory containing nativePlayerInjector.ts and any template files. This component intercepts video playback routes and is no longer needed. Use file system operations to remove the directory and all contents.</action>
  <verify>Directory no longer exists: `ls src/components/native-player-injector 2>&1` should return "No such file or directory"</verify>
  <done>Directory src/components/native-player-injector/ deleted from filesystem</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Clean up compiled output in dist</name>
  <files>dist/components/native-player-controls/, dist/components/native-player-injector/</files>
  <action>Delete the compiled component directories in dist/ if they exist. Check for and remove both `dist/components/native-player-controls/` and `dist/components/native-player-injector/`. These are build artifacts that should be cleaned up. It's OK if they don't exist (dist/ may not be committed).</action>
  <verify>Directories no longer exist in dist: `ls dist/components/native-player-* 2>&1` should show "No such file or directory"</verify>
  <done>Compiled component directories removed from dist/ (if they existed)</done>
</task>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] `ls src/components/ | grep native-player` returns no results
- [ ] `ls dist/components/ 2>/dev/null | grep native-player` returns no results
- [ ] Git status shows deleted directories ready to commit
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- All native player component directories removed from src/
- Compiled outputs removed from dist/ (if present)
- No native-player directories remain in components/
- Changes staged and ready for commit

# Phase 2 Plan 1: Component Directory Removal Summary

**Removed native player UI component directories: 2 directories deleted**

## Accomplishments

- Deleted src/components/native-player-controls/ directory
- Deleted src/components/native-player-injector/ directory
- Cleaned up compiled outputs in dist/components/
- First major step in MPV integration cleanup complete

## Files Created/Modified

**Deleted:**
- `src/components/native-player-controls/` (directory)
- `src/components/native-player-injector/` (directory)
- `dist/components/native-player-controls/` (if existed)
- `dist/components/native-player-injector/` (if existed)

## Decisions Made

None - straightforward file deletion as planned

## Issues Encountered

None expected - directories are self-contained components

## Next Step

Ready for **02-02-PLAN.md** - Remove core utility files (MpvManager, MpvBinaryManager, NativePlayerConfig)
</output>
