<objective>
Run the app in development mode and verify the original Stremio player loads and plays content correctly without any MPV integration traces.

Purpose: Confirm that the MPV/V5 integration removal has not broken the original Stremio web player functionality. Verify video playback, UI rendering, and plugin/theme system work as expected.
Output: Working StreamGo application with original Stremio player confirmed functional, zero runtime errors related to MPV integration.

**Prior phase context:**
- Phase 7 Plan 1 complete: npm run dist succeeded with zero errors, dist/ directory built successfully
- Phase 1-6 complete: All MPV integration removed, UI cleaned, dependencies removed
- Build system verified: TypeScript compilation clean, component templates copied

**Development environment:**
- Dev command: `npm run dev` = compile + run Electron with devtools open
- App loads: https://web.stremio.com/ in Electron BrowserWindow
- Original player: Stremio's web player (not MPV)
- Architecture: Electron wrapper around Stremio web player with plugin/theme injection

**What to verify:**
1. App launches without errors
2. Stremio web player loads (https://web.stremio.com/)
3. No console errors related to missing MPV files or IPC channels
4. Original player can load and play video content
5. Plus Page (Settings) accessible without native player category
6. Plugin/theme system functional (unrelated to MPV)

**Checkpoint needed:**
This is a human-verify checkpoint because we need visual confirmation that:
- The UI renders correctly without native player elements
- Video playback works (requires actual streaming test)
- No error dialogs or console errors appear

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Launch app in development mode</name>
  <files>none</files>
  <action>Execute `npm run dev` to compile and launch the Electron app with DevTools open. This runs the full build (tsc + copyComponents.js) then starts Electron with `--devtools` flag. Capture the launch output and note any errors. The app should launch and load https://web.stremio.com/ in the main window. Let it run for 10-15 seconds to allow full initialization (Discord RPC, streaming server, settings injection).</action>
  <verify>Command starts successfully, Electron window opens, DevTools available</verify>
  <done>App launches without errors, main window visible with DevTools open, no immediate crashes or error dialogs</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>StreamGo app running in dev mode with original Stremio player</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Confirm: Main window shows Stremio web player interface (not error page)
    2. Open: DevTools Console tab (should already be open from --devtools flag)
    3. Check Console: Look for any errors mentioning "mpv", "native-player", "IPC channel", or "undefined"
    4. Navigate: Click "Discover" or "Board" in Stremio UI - verify navigation works
    5. Test Settings: Click Plus icon → verify Plus Page loads without "Native Player" category
    6. Test Playback (if possible): Try to play any content (movie/show trailer) - verify original player loads
    7. Check Plugins/Themes: Plus Page → Plugins/Themes tabs visible and functional
    8. Expected results:
       - No console errors related to MPV or native player
       - Stremio web player UI renders correctly
       - Plus Page has Plugins, Themes, Updates tabs (no Native Player tab)
       - Video playback starts using original Stremio player (if tested)
       - No missing IPC channel errors or undefined reference errors
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if verification passes, or describe any issues/errors found</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Stop dev server and analyze results</name>
  <files>none</files>
  <action>After human verification complete, stop the Electron app (Ctrl+C in terminal or close window). Review the terminal output for any warnings or errors that occurred during runtime. Check for any unhandled promise rejections, deprecation warnings, or IPC channel errors that might indicate missed cleanup. Document any issues found for inclusion in summary.</action>
  <verify>App shuts down cleanly, terminal output reviewed</verify>
  <done>Development session complete, runtime behavior documented, any issues logged</done>

# Phase 7 Plan 2: Development Mode Verification Summary

**[Substantive one-liner - app runs successfully with original player or issues found]**

## Accomplishments

- [App launch outcome - success or errors]
- [Console verification results]
- [UI rendering status]
- [Plus Page verification results]
- [Video playback test results (if performed)]

## Files Created/Modified

None - verification-only phase

## Decisions Made

[Any decisions about issues found or functionality verified, or "None"]

## Issues Encountered

[Runtime problems discovered and how addressed, or "None"]

## Next Phase Readiness

**Phase 8: Final Validation** - Ready to begin

Next tasks: Comprehensive codebase search for any remaining MPV/V5 references and final cleanup documentation.

Evidence:
- App builds successfully (Phase 7 Plan 1)
- App runs without MPV-related errors (Phase 7 Plan 2)
- Original player functional
- No blockers for Phase 8
</output>
